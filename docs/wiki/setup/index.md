title: Setup the applications
---

Here are some guides to help you set up the applications. We assume you left the
default ports; if you changed them, you will need to change the ports in the
URLs. Same if you are using a domain nameâ€”change the URLs to match. We assume
you are using the [first example](/wiki/examples/example-1) in your Nix
configuration. Replace {URL} in this document with your server IP or domain.

In the below setup, we assume you also didn't set the `nixarr.mediaDir`
option, which by default is set to `/data/media`.

## Jellyfin

- Open your browser and go to `{URL}:8096`.
- Click `Add Server` and put your server address
- Follow the setup wizard:
  - Create your administrator account.
  - Setup two libraries:
    - Movies: Choose "Movies" as content type, then add the
      `/data/media/library/movies` folder.
    - TV Shows: Same with `/data/media/library` as the folder.
    - You can add music, books, etc.
  - Continue the setup.

**Recommendations:**:

- Reduce the scan media library interval for small libraries: See
  `Scheduled Tasks`: {URL}:8096/web/index.html#/dashboard/tasks/

## Transmission

Transmission should already be setup and running since it's configured
with JSON, and can therefore be configured with nix. The most basic settings are already set. See the following links for more info:

- [The configured Nixarr defaults for transmission](https://github.com/rasmus-kirk/nixarr/blob/28d1be070deb1a064c1967889c11c8921752fa09/nixarr/transmission/default.nix#L355)
